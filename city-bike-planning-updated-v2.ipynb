    "## Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to walk you through the data science lifecycle, introducing you to many different data science concepts. The data science lifecycle goes as follows: \n",
    "1. Data collection\n",
    "3. Data processing\n",
    "4. Exploratory analysis and Data visualization\n",
    "5. Model analysis and testing\n",
    "6. Interpretation of results\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole purpose of the data science lifecycle is to identify trends or patterns, investigate or answer a question, or solve a problem. In this tutorial, we will be looking to build a model to help us answer the question: Why and When do people in Washington D.C use electric bikes over normal bikes? Although we will not come to an exact answer at the end of this tutorial, building a model, will help us make some conclusion, which may lead us to an answer in the future. However, it is still important to understand the underlying goal of answering this question. By answering this question, we will be able to determine factors which influence the use of electric bikes. These factors could be distance between stations, amount of time biker wants to ride, specific location in the city, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "By determining these factors, we can make necessary changes to distribute our electric bikes accordingly. For example, if based on the model, we can see that people at a certain station always ride electric bikes, we can place more electric bikes in that location, while moving normal bikes to other locations. This change would be helpful, as there would be more electric bikes available at the location where it is used more, ensuring that people will have their choice of transportation. It also saves time for the company, since they do not have to ensure locations have both electric and normal bikes. By answering our question in regards to electric bikes, we can answer the same question for normal bikes, and then be able to distribute both types of bikes accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this doesn't have to be the only question we answer, as a data scientist is always on the lookout for new observations and discoveries in their data. Throughout this tutorial, we will ask questions, in which you can also then consider if there is anything else you could've done in addition to what we provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT** \n",
    "<br>For this tutorial, please note that an observation refers to one row of the table. In other words, one observation is one recorded bike ride."

    "## Part 1: Data Collection\n",
    "In order to reach our end goal and answer our question at hand, we must first begin by collecting the data necessary to answer our question. It is important to find the appropriate dataset for your situation, as later on, your machine learning model is as good as the data you feed into it. And since your machine learning model is the tool that will be used to find the answer to your question, then essentially your answer is reliant on the dataset you use. Therefore, it is important to collect the appropriate dataset.\n",

    "Usually, a company may have to conduct their own experiments or studies to collect the necessary data they need. However, oftentimes, these tasks are already done by other companies, and avaialble to use for the public. For our tutorial, we will be using a dataset provided by Capital Bike Share."

Since we're using the type of bike ridden in a trip as our dependent variable, we want to check for any skew in the frequency of each class. If there is a significant imbalance in classes, we would take a subsample of the excess class to match the number of the smaller class."

    "### One Hot Encoding\n",
    "One-hot encoding is an essential technique for data scientists, used to convert multiclass categorical data into integer representations. For binary classification, we typically represent one class as 0 and the other as 1. However, for multiclass scenarios, we break the data into multiple columns, each representing a class. Importantly, we only need \\( n-1 \\) columns for \\( n \\) classes. This is because if all the other columns are 0, we can infer that the remaining class must be 1. Essentially, one class is dependent on the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people might initially think that we can simply use 1 for one class, 2 for the next class, 3 for the following class, and so on. However, this approach can bias our machine learning algorithms, as it may inadvertently assign more importance to higher numerical values. Instead, we use one-hot encoding to avoid this issue. For example, with four classes, one-hot encoding would represent them as (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0), and (0,0,0,1). This way, each class is treated equally, and no unintended hierarchical relationship is introduced. We can drop one of the columns listed to reduce the number of features."

A histogram is useful in identifying any outliers in our data, as it shows the distribution of our data (how it differs according to a variable). As we can see from the graph, we know that a large majority of the data points lie below 200 minutes. Therefore, we have the choice of removing any data points above 200 minutes, as they may be outliers."

    "### Some Interesting Data Cleaning: Ranking\n",
    "Let's now create a new column, data point, called rank. This data point will represent the frequency of a start or end station being the destination across all observations. So, a higher rank for a start station indicates more people start at that station then others, while low rank means less people begin at that station. The same applies for the end station. This rank system is an example of modifying our data to be a data point that is usable. We can't really pass in string values, such as the station names, into the machine learning model. Therefore, transforming it into an integer value, such as rank, can help make it useful."

    "## Part 4: Interpretation of Results\n",
    "As a data scientist, it is important to interpret your results, in order to communicate the significance or maybe insignificance of what you found. Regardless, you will need to report and share with your team, making the numbers make sense. For a more specific case, we would need to interpret the results in terms of the problem or question at hand. So, for this tutorial, our original question was Why and When do people in Washington D.C use electric bikes over normal bikes? *How can we use the results we found to help answer this question?*\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to understand that sometimes, our results don't provide a clear answer. But, it will always provide us some guidance or insight into our question/answer.\n",
