    "## Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to walk you through the data science lifecycle, introducing you to many different data science concepts. The data science lifecycle goes as follows: \n",
    "1. Data collection\n",
    "3. Data processing\n",
    "4. Exploratory analysis and Data visualization\n",
    "5. Model analysis and testing\n",
    "6. Interpretation of results\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole purpose of the data science lifecycle is to identify trends or patterns, investigate or answer a question, or solve a problem. In this tutorial, we will be looking to answer the question: SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING. By coming up with a answer, we will be able to SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING. \n",

    "## Part 1: Data Collection\n",
    "In order to reach our end goal and finding OUR GOAL FOR QUESTION OR PROBLEM OR SOMETHING SOMETHING, we must first begin by collecting the data necessary to answer our question. It is important to find the appropriate dataset for your situation, as later on, your machine learning model is as good as the data you feed into it. And since your machine learning model is the tool that will be used to find the answer to your question, then essentially your answer is reliant on the dataset you use. Therefore, it is important to collect the appropriate dataset.\n",

    "Usually, a company may have to conduct their own experiments or studies to collect the necessary data they need. However, oftentimes, these tasks are already done by other companies, and avaialble to use for the public. For our tutorial, we will be using a dataset provided by Capital Bike Share.\n",

You should use Jupyter Notebook, as most of the code provided is run in Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook is also widely used by data scientists, as it allows us to better visualize our data and other analysis. We will dive more in detail about the use of each of these libraries as we encounter and use each one."

This process may involve many different things, some examples are:\n",

We've combined these two steps, because sometimes it is helpful to perform exploratory analysis on our dataset, in order to help determine what things we need to clean. For example, we may plot a graph of two data points, in order to see if there any noticeable trends, which may prompt us to create a new data point, that we may believe to be useful for the machine learning model to use.\n",

This analysis may also help guide our question or research, as mentioned earlier, where we may notice one data point is significant in some sort of way.\n",

Since we're using the type of bike ridden in a trip as our dependent variable, we want to check for any skew in the frequency of each class. If there is a significant imbalance in classes, we would take a subsample of the excess class to match the number of the smaller class."

    "### One Hot Encoding\n",
    "One-hot encoding is an essential technique for data scientists, used to convert multiclass categorical data into integer representations. For binary classification, we typically represent one class as 0 and the other as 1. However, for multiclass scenarios, we break the data into multiple columns, each representing a class. Importantly, we only need \\( n-1 \\) columns for \\( n \\) classes. This is because if all the other columns are 0, we can infer that the remaining class must be 1. Essentially, one class is dependent on the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people might initially think that we can simply use 1 for one class, 2 for the next class, 3 for the following class, and so on. However, this approach can bias our machine learning algorithms, as it may inadvertently assign more importance to higher numerical values. Instead, we use one-hot encoding to avoid this issue. For example, with four classes, one-hot encoding would represent them as (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0), and (0,0,0,1). This way, each class is treated equally, and no unintended hierarchical relationship is introduced. We can drop one of the columns listed to reduce the number of features."

    "### Some Exploratory Analysis #3\n",
    "Let's perform some more exploratory analysis. From outputting our data table early on, did you notice some peculiar data points, specifically for our 'time duration' and 'average speed' data points? Some of the values seemed a little to unrealistic, for example, a person was riding for a total of 1400 minutes, which is about 24 hours??? On the other hand for average speed, some people were traveling at 250 km/hr DOUBLE CHECK THIS VALUE?? Sometimes, unrealistic data points may have been a result of an error or mistake in the data collection phase. Therefore, it is important to identify these points, and eliminate any points, which may seem incorrect. The graph below serves to compare these potential outliers, and identify any other ones. WHY WE PLOT AVERGAE SPEED VS TIME DURATION? MAYBE MENTION SCATTER PLOT ALSO GOOD FOR SEEING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TWO VARIABLES?"

    "### Some Interesting Data Cleaning: Ranking\n",
    "Let's now create a new column, data point, called rank. This data point will represent the frequency of a start or end station being the destination across all observations. So, a higher rank for a start station indicates more people start at that station then others, while low rank means less people begin at that station. The same applies for the end station. This rank system is an example of modifying our data to be a data point that is usable. We can't really pass in string values, such as the station names, into the machine learning model. Therefore, transforming it into an integer value, such as rank, can help make it useful."
